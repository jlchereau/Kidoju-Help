The GO button displays a menu with 4 options:

* Feedback,
* Cancel.

Press **Play** to display the first page of the selected Kidoju.

On each page, follow the instructions. You can read them aloud using text-to-speech technology by pressing the ear button.

There are two ways to navigate between pages:
