The first option in the drawer displays the **Explorer **with a hierarchical list of categories \(aka subjects\):

Pressing any category or the magnifier in the header displays a list of search results with a search box at the top.

The search results are colored as follows:

* With a **transparent **background \(which translates into a light or dark background depending on the selected theme - here white\), the Kidojus which have never been played;
* With an **alternate **background \(which translates into a darker or lighter background depending on the selected theme - here grey\), the Kidojus which have been played but never submitted;
* With a **red** background, the Kidojus which have resulted in a score of less than 50%;
* With a **yellow/orange** background, the Kidojus which have resulted in a score of less than 75%;
* With a **green** background, the Kidojus which have resulted in a score of more than 75%.

> Note: The Kidojus with alternate, red, yellow/orange and green backgrounds have been played at least once and are available offline. At present, the assets \(images, audio and video\) are only cached for a limited period of time. We are currently evaluating various cache strategies for future versions considering the size of media files and the limited storage capacity of mobile devices.
