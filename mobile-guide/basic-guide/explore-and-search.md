The first option displays the Explorer with a hierarchical list of categories \(aka subjects\):

Pressing any category or the magnifier in the header displays a list of search results with a search box at the top.

The search results are colored as follows:

* With a **transparent **background \(which translates into a light or dark background depending on the selected theme - here white\), the Kidojus which have never been played;
* With an **alternate **background \(which translates into a darker or lighter background depending on the selected theme - here grey\), the Kidojus which have been played but never submitted;
* With a red background, the Kidojus which have resulted into a score of less than 50%;
