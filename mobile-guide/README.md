# Mobile Application Guide {#prerequisites}

## Prerequisites

You need access to an iOS or Android device to run our mobile applications. These applications run on iOS 10+ and Android 4.4+ \(including Amazon FireOS\). Any device released in the last 3 years should have enough processing power and memory to run the applications.

We recommend a screen of at least 5.5” to play Kidojus.

> Note: the mobile applications are only for playing Kidojus. Kidojus have to be authored with the web application.

## Installation

We are in the process of offering one application for each year of the national curriculum in the UK and France. The first year \(Reception in the UK and CP in France\) is free for you to try.
