# Introduction {#introduction}

Kidoju is a web-based community platform to produce, share and consume highly-interactive self-corrected knowledge tests or quizzes.

Kidoju is available at https://www.kidoju.com.

Quizzes are often assimilated to multiple choice questions. So we sometime refer to quizzes developed with the Kidoju rich toolset as “Kidoju quizzes” or simply as “Kidojus”.

This guide is divided into the following sections:

*   The current introduction,
*   Definitions and concepts underlying Kidoju,
*   A student guide for consuming Kidojus.
*   A teacher/publisher guide for producing Kidojus.
*   An advanced guide.
