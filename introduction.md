# Introduction {#introduction}

Kidoju is a web-based community platform to author, share and play highly-interactive self-corrected knowledge tests, exercises, assessments or quizzes.

Kidoju is available as a web application at [https://www.kidoju.com](https://www.kidoju.com) and as mobile applications for iOS and Android.

Quizzes are often limited to multiple choice questions. Kidoju can do a lot more, so we sometime refer to quizzes developed with the Kidoju rich toolset as “Kidoju quizzes”, “Kidoju content” or simply “Kidojus”.
