## Tools, pages and components {#tools-pages-and-components}

The Kidoju web-based _Editor_ provides tools to build knowledge tests. These tools include labels, radios, checkboxes, textboxes, images, audio, video, mathematic expressions, connectors, drop zones among others.

A Kidoju is divided into pages (aka slides in PowerPoint®). Each page comprises components.

The **Navigation** in the left pane of the _Editor_ displays all pages in a Kidoju. Selecting a page in the navigation, displays the corresponding page in the centre pane of the _Editor_. The interactive area in the centre pane is called the **Stage**.

**Stage**

**Navigation**

A tool might be used to drop a component (aka element) onto the stage. For example, a label tool can be used to drop a label component onto the stage. In such a case, the term “label” might designate the tool from the toolbox or the corresponding component dropped on the stage. The tool defines a template. The component is an instance of this template on a page.

The previous screenshot shows both the label tool selected in the toolbox and a label component dropped onto the stage, where the first and only page is selected in the navigation for editing.

Note: for now, you only need to remember that a Kidoju is made of pages which comprise components created by tools.
