## Publication, versioning and activities {#publication-versioning-and-activities}

Kidojus are versioned. There is no limit to the number of versions a Kidoju might have.

When initially created, a Kidoju and its first version are in a draft state until they are published. Draft Kidojus do not appear in search results and can only be played by their author. In a draft state, activities including views and scores are not tracked.

Once a Kidoju is ready to be played by others, the author should publish it. The Kidoju and its first version progress from the draft state to a published state. Thereafter, published Kidojus appear in search results and activities, including views and scores, are tracked.

Pages and components of a published version cannot be modified. The icon, title, categories, tags, description of a Kidoju can be modified at any time.

When the pages of a published Kidoju need to be updated, the author creates a new draft version. The Kidoju remains in a published state and the latest published version prevails until the new draft version is published.

Versioning Kidojus allows users to view their scores and corrections at any time although a Kidoju might have been improved with new, updated or deleted questions.
