## Languages and categories {#languages-and-categories}

Kidojus are organised in a hierarchy of categories \(aka subjects\) for each language.



There are currently two languages to choose from in the footer of the web application: English and French. More languages will be coming soon.

Selecting a language in the footer redirects the user to an explorer with a tree of categories \(aka topics\) in the corresponding language. Clicking a category in this tree displays a list of Kidojus pertaining to the selected category.

> Note: languages and categories classify Kidojus.
