## Indexation and searches {#indexation-and-searches}

> Note: pages and components of Kidojus are not indexed for full-text searches.

The weight of each field in the full-text index is as follows:

* Author: 8
* Tags: 4,
* Title: 2,
* Description: 1

On the basis of a search on the word “steel”, Kidojus made by authors named “Steel” will be listed first, then Kidojus that have the word “steel” among their tags will be listed second, and so on.

As a consequence, an author who designs a Kidoju about Napoleonic Wars, should make sure that Napoleon is quoted in the title or amongst tags to make it findable in a search on “Napoleon”. To increase the ranking, this author can add the word Napoleon to the title, tags and description.

## Web searches and social networks

The title and description is also used in web searches and when sharing on social networks.
