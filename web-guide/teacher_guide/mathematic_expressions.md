## Mathematic expressions {#mathematic-expressions}

Mathematic expressions are similar to labels, expect they have the capability to interpret a textual expression into a better graphic representation of a formula.

To add a mathematic expression to the stage, select (click) the **Mathematic Expression** tool in the toolbox and click the stage. A new mathematic expression is added to the page.

Position and resize the label as explained in the _Moving, rotating, resizing and aligning components_ chapter.

To change the formula displayed, expand the **Display attributes** collapsible panel and change the value of the **Formula** property for #int_0^1 f(x)dx#.

To learn more about formulas please refer to the LaTeX and AsciiMath section of the Advanced Guide.
