## Connectors {#connectors}

Connectors are used to draw connections especially between images and legends.

Add a fourth page as explained in the _Adding, removing, duplicating and sorting pages_ chapter. Add a label as explained in the _Labels_ chapter. Add an image as explained in the _Images_ chapter using http://cliparts.co/clipart/17129\. Try to complete the following screenshot.

To add a connector to the stage, select (click) the **Connector** tool in the toolbox and click the stage. A new connector is added to the page.

Select a contrasted colour in the **Colour** property of the **Display attributes** collapsible panel of the tools pane. Make sure this colour fits with light and dark themes.

Click the menu handle and the **Duplicate** command to create 4 connectors and position them as represented below:

Fill the test logic of all four connectors as follows:

|  | Question | Solution | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1 | Connect the wheel on the image with the wheel label? | Wheel | equal |
| #2 | Connect the wheel on the image to the wheel label? | Wheel | equal |
| #3 | Connect the body on the image to the body label? | Body | equal |
| #4 | Connect the body on the image to the body label? | Body | equal |

Keep default values for the **Success**, **Failure** and **Omit** points.

Add two labels respectively for “Body” and “Wheel” and position them as above.

IMPORTANT! Sort your connectors in the page explorer so that they are all listed at the bottom. The reason is you want connections to be displayed on top of images and labels.

Note: do not forget to save your work often.
