### Retrieving a draft test

Before we describe the _Editor_, you need to know how to retrieve a draft Kidoju in progress, considering only published Kidojus are listed in the search results of the _Explorer_.

After signing in from the _Home page_ as explained above, click your name in the site navigation at the top of the page to access your profile in a _User page_.

The Kidoju you have just created is first in the list. Click the **Edit** button to navigate to the _Editor_.
