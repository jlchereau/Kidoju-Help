## Images {#images}

Images show the content of gif, jpeg, png and svg files on stage. To add an image to the stage, select (click) the **Image** tool in the toolbox and click the stage. A new image is added to the page.

Prepare an image of your choice. We suggest [http://cliparts.co/clipart/223399](http://cliparts.co/clipart/223399) which you can download before uploading it to Kidoju.

Select the **Source** property in the **Display attributes** collapsible panel of the tools pane and click the **[â€¦]** button. Click the **Upload** button, select your file on your hard drive and click the **Open** button.

Note: The tabs on the left give access to image collections which have already been uploaded for your perusal.

Note: Considering mobile devices on 3G/4G plans, we limit the size of images you can upload to 400 Kb. Any larger file would trigger an error.

When your image is displayed in the **Source** dialog as above, it has been uploaded onto our servers. Click **OK** to assign this file to the image source. Resize the image component on the stage and consider filling the alternate **Text** property in the display attributes especially for blind people.
