## Moving, rotating, resizing and aligning components {#moving-rotating-resizing-and-aligning-components}

First select the image component on the stage by clicking it, then:

*   Drag the move handle to move the component,
*   Drag the rotate handle to rotate the component,
*   Drag the resize handle to resize the component.

Note: image resizing is constrained proportionally.

Alternatively, after selecting the component, expand the **Display attributes** collapsible panel to show the **top**, **left**, **height**, **width** and **rotate** attributes:

Enter the values you deem appropriate and remember to click the **Save** button often.

Note: The size of a page is 1024px * 768px. A px or pixel is a dot on the screen. The point at coordinates (0, 0) is the top left corner. Therefore, the point at coordinates (1024, 768) is the bottom right corner.

When you need to align components, there is a better option than copying and pasting top and left values across components. Expand the **Alignments** collapsible panel in the tools pane and set the **Grid** slider. This creates what some people call a snap grid.

The value of the **Grid** slider from 0 to 50 sets the step in pixels of acceptable values for positioning (top, left) and resizing (height, width) components, making it much easier to align or distribute evenly components on the stage.

The **Angle** slider, taking values from 0 to 45 degrees, works the same way with rotation.

Note: when resizing components that have test logic, consider the Position of correction ticks and crosses in the Advanced Guide.
