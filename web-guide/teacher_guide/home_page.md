After signing in, click the  **Create** button which is now available in the site navigation at the top of the page. A dialog window is displayed. Fill the category and title. The category determines the default icon. These can be modified at any time when required.

Once you are happy with your entries, confirm by clicking the **Create** button at the bottom right of the dialog window. You have just created a blank Kidoju and you are now redirected to the editor.
