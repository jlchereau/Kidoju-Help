### Editor

The editor is organized like Microsoft® PowerPoint®.

**Tools**

**Stage**

**Navi-gation**

The screen is divided into three panes between a header including the toolbar and a footer:

* On the left, the **Navigation** pane consists in a list of pages \(aka slides in PowerPoint®\), any of which can be selected by clicking it;
* In the centre, the **Stage** pane displays the selected page in design mode for editing;
* On the right, the **Tools** pane displays collapsible panels to select tools and assign values.

We like to say that Kidojus are PowerPoint® presentations with the ability to ask questions, record user answers and calculate a score. These answers can not only be plain values but also user interactions including clicks and drag and drop sequences.

Note: Contrary to PowerPoint®, Kidoju is web based software involving a complex architecture starting with your browser on your device, multiple nodes on the Internet which we have no control of, a firewall, a load balancer, web proxies, application servers and database servers. Although we do our best to give you the best experience, anything can happen at any location in the chain. Accordingly, please consider saving often.
