### Explorer

In addition to the header menu and footer we have previously mentioned, the explorer has a tree of categories \(aka topics\) on the left and a list of Kidojus on the right.

Navigating the tree brings relevant Kidojus into the list. For example, select “Mathematics” in the tree to display all Kidojus pertaining to the Mathematics category.

Note: categories do not aggregate subcategories. In other words, if a Kidoju has been classified in the Algebra category, but not in the Mathematics category, it would only be found by selecting the Algebra category. Categories work like Windows® and macOS® folders.

A Kidoju is listed with its icon, title, tags, publication date, author and metrics including average rating, total \(authenticated\) views and average score.

Note: Being authenticated is not required to view and play Kidojus and anonymous views are not counted.

Each Kidoju in the list has two buttons respectively entitled **Details** and **Play**.

Clicking the icon or title is the same has clicking the **Details** button.

Clicking any tag displays all Kidojus that have the same tag.

Clicking the author name displays a full author profile with a list of Kidojus by the same author.
