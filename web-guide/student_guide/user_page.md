### User page

The User page displays a user profile. A profile has public and private fields. Private fields like emails and activities are only accessible to their owner. In other words, you do not see the same fields whether you display your own profile or someone else’s profile in a User page.

#### Author profiles

Author profiles can be accessed when clicking an author’s name in the _Explorer_ or on a _Details page_.

Author profiles display the full name, a picture and a list of contributions.

#### My profile

You need to be signed in to display your own user profile by clicking your name in the site navigation at the top of the page.

Your user profile gives you access to your list of activities including your recent scores.

Clicking a score in the list of activities displays the corresponding detailed report which you can review at any time.
