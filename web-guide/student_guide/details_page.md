## Details page {#details-page}

The Details page is also called the summary page. It represents the detailed summary of a Kidoju. Think of it as an index card in a library catalogue as opposed to the book itself.

The Details page is divided into the following panels.

In the left (larger) column:

*   The **Properties** and **Description** panels contain the fields that are indexed for full-text searches.
*   The **Scores** panel displays a distribution of user scores in a histogram graduated from 0% to 100% with a step of 5%.
*   The **Comments** panel displays a list of comments. A user needs to be signed in (authenticated) to add comments.

In the right (narrower) column

*   The **Author** panel displays a short profile. The name is clickable to display a full profile in a _User page_.
*   The **Share** panel displays a list of buttons to share Kidojus on social networks. The **Embed** tab is explained in the Advanced Guide.
*   The **Statistics** panel displays statistics about the current Kidoju. A user needs to be signed in (authenticated) to rate a Kidoju by clicking any number of stars.
*   The **QR Code** panel displays a machine-readable visual code which can be used to retrieve a Kidoju, especially with the Kidoju mobile application.

Search on “QR Code” in the Apple App Store or in the Google Play Store to find QR Code readers for your mobile devices.

As a guest (anonymous) user, there are only two use cases that can be completed from the details page of a Kidoju:

As a signed-in (authenticated) user, who is not the author, there are two more use cases that can be completed from the details page of a Kidoju:
