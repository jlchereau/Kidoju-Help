### Benefits of being signed in

Kidoju does not force users into being signed in to withdraw benefits from the platform. In particular searching and playing Kidojus does not require being authenticated.

The platform does not keep track of anonymous user activities. Especially view counts discard anonymous users.

Being signed-in as a student \(or consumer of Kidojus\) provides 3 additional benefits:

* Authenticated users can access corrections.
* Authenticated users can comment and rate Kidojus.
* Authenticated users can keep track of their activities and scores.

Signing in, using a Google, Facebook, Twitter or Windows Live account, after submitting a score, sends your answers to our servers, so that we can save them and display your detailed results in a grid below the score chart.

Note: the only information we get from this authentication procedure is your name, picture and email address. Kidoju does not read your social network contacts and messages. We also do not get any authorization to write to your wall or send messages to your contacts. Your name and picture are displayed in miscellaneous places. Your email address is never disclosed.

Clicking a line in the results grid sends you directly to the page with the correction displayed as a tick or a cross with explanations:

Note: Notice how instructions in play mode have turned into explanations in review \(correction\) mode.

You can always switch back to the score chart and results grid by clicking the **Score** button in the toolbar.

The **Reset** button replays the Kidoju from the beginning. If you are not authenticated your previous score is lost.

Assuming you have played a Kidoju several times as an authenticated user, therefore saving your score at each attempt, a dropdown list of scores in the toolbar gives you access to the history to check your progresses on each page.
