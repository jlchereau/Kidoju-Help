## Audio and video file formats {#audio-and-video-file-formats}

Audio and video file formats (and codecs) are a complex issue to run across all types of devices and browsers.

### Audio {#audio}

There are two main audio file formats required to run audio across devices and browsers: MP3 and OGG.

| Extension | Chrome | Edge/IE | Firefox | Opera | Safari |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MP3 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  | ✓ |
| OGG | ✓ |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |

Currently:

1.  If you only upload one format, use MP3 which has the largest support.
2.  For even better support, you need to also upload the OGG format to our servers (we plan to convert files automatically in the future but in the meantime please consider using cloudconvert.com, zamzar.com or any other file conversion services);
3.  Some browsers may restrict the upload of file formats they cannot identify, which is the reason why we recommend using Chrome.

Note: we might replace MP3 with M4A (AAC) in the near future.

### Video {#video}

There are three main video file formats required to run video across devices and browsers: MP4 and either OGV or WEBM.

| Extension | Chrome | Edge/IE | Firefox | Opera | Safari |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MP4 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| OGV | ✓ |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| WEBM | ✓ |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |

Currently:

1.  If you only upload one format, use MP4 which has the largest support.
2.  For even better support, you need to also upload the OGV or WEBM format to our servers (we plan to convert files automatically in the future but in the meantime please consider using cloudconvert.com, zamzar.com or any other file conversion services);
