## Markdown {#markdown}

Markdown is a simple and secure way to add formatting to text in web applications. Kidoju uses markdown syntax for descriptions including _User instructions and explanations_.

| Formatted text | Markdown |
| --- | --- |
| _Italic_ | Text surrounded by * or _: |
| **Bold** | Text surrounded by ** or __: |
| **Heading** | Line starting with hashtags (#) where the number of # defines the heading level: |
| 

1.  Numbered
2.  List

 | Set of successive lines preceded by any number and a period: |
| 

*   Bulleted
*   List

 | Set of successive lines preceded by *, + or â€“: |
| Hyperlink | Text between square brackets followed by url between parentheses: |
| ![https://www.iconexperience.com/_img/g/style128.png](../assets/httpswwwiconexperiencecomimg.png) | Exclamation mark followed by alternate text between square brackets followed by source url between parentheses: |

A character can always be enforced by preceding it with a backslash. For example, \*Italic\* will actually display the word Italic between two stars in regular style (without emphasis).
