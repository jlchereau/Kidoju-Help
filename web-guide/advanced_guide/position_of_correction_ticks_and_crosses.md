## Position of correction ticks and crosses {#position-of-correction-ticks-and-crosses}

In the _Student_ Guide, you have discovered the _Player_ in play mode and review (correction) mode. Review mode shows ticks and crosses as in the following example:

The position of the correction tick or cross is actually determined by the position of the resize handle as represented here below.

In the following screenshot, we have moved the resize handle away from the content of the quiz component (1, 2, 3, 4) to the bottom right corner of the stage.

The correction tick or cross follows the position of the resize handle as shown on the following screenshot.

Therefore, consider carefully where you position the resize handle of the components which participate in the test logic:

*   You do not want a resize handle too close to the content because font sizes are not consistent across devices and you need to allow some space;
*   You do not want a resize handle too far away from the content because the tick or cross might interfere with other components and become ambiguous.
