# Introduction {#introduction}

Kidoju is a web-based community platform to author, share and play highly-interactive self-corrected knowledge tests, exercises, assessments or quizzes.

Kidoju is available as a web application at [https://www.kidoju.com](https://www.kidoju.com).

Quizzes are often limited to multiple choice questions. So we sometime refer to quizzes developed with the Kidoju rich toolset as “Kidoju quizzes”, “Kidoju content” or simply “Kidojus”.

This guide is divided into the following sections:

* The current introduction,
* Definitions and concepts underlying Kidoju,
* A student guide for consuming Kidojus,
* A teacher/publisher guide for producing simple Kidojus,
* An advanced guide for producing complex Kidojus.
