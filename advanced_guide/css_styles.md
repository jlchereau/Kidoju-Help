## CSS styles {#css-styles}

We cannot cover the diversity of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attributes to define styles. A CSS style is a collection of attributes and values where each attribute is separated from its value by a colon (:) and pairs of “attribute:value” are separated from each other by semi-colons (;), like in background-color:#ffffff; color:#000000.

Note: colors are only used to help you distinguish attributes in green from values in blue from separators in red.

A label similar to the above can be achieved with the following style attributes which are self-explicit:

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| background-color | #bdd7ee |
| border-color | #2e75b6 |
| border-radius | 25px |
| border-style | Solid |
| border-width | 4px |
| color | #ffffff |
| font-family | Times New Roman |
| font-size | 60px |
| padding | 30px |

Note: colors are expressed as hexadecimal values where each couple of digits represents respectively the amount of red, green and blue (RGB).

Note: sizes are expressed in pixels where a pixel is a dot on the screen. A typical monitor resolution is either 72 ppi or 96 ppi (pixels per inch). Retina monitors have higher ppi. A typical printer prints at 300 dpi (dots per inch).
