## Player {#player}

Clicking the **Play** button from the _Details page_ or from the _Explorer_ navigates to the Kidoju player. Any version can be played from the _Details page_ whereas only the current (latest) published version can be played from the _Explorer_.

To move from page to page, either use the left and right arrows on the page or click the numbered buttons in the toolbar.

Note: navigating between pages stores user entries in the browser.

After having navigated all pages and answered all questions, click the **Submit** button to calculate your score.

Click the **Reset** button to replay the current Kidoju from the beginning. If you are not authenticated your previous score is lost.
