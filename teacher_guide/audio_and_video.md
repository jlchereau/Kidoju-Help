## Audio and video {#audio-and-video}

Audio and video are very similar to images from a workflow perspective. Like images, you add the component on the stage and upload and link the files to play.

Audio play the content of mp3 and ogg files. Video play the content of mp4, ogv and wbem files. You can read more about file formats in the _Audio and video file formats_ section of the _Advanced Guide_. Audio and video being very similar, the following step-by-step instructions focus on audio. You can try adding videos by yourself.

To add an audio player to the stage, select (click) the **Audio** tool in the toolbox and click the stage. A new audio player is added to the page.

Prepare audio files of your choice. We suggest [http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=151](http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=151) which you can download before uploading both the mp3 and ogg formats to Kidoju.

Select respectively the **MP3 File** and **OGG File** properties in the **Display attributes** collapsible panel of the tools pane and click the […] button. Click the **Upload** button, select your file on your hard drive and click the **Open** button.

When your audio file is displayed in the **MP3 File** dialog as above, it has been uploaded onto our servers. Click **OK** to assign this file to the audio player.

Note: while uploading your file, you might get the following error: “There was an error obtaining a secure upload url. Make sure your file size is reasonable and your file name has a well-known extension”.

In this case, most probably your file is too big. Considering mobile devices on 3G/4G plans, we limit the size of files you can upload. These limits are currently 400 Kb for images and audio files and 4 Mb for video files.

After assigning an MP3 File and an OGG File, your audio player is now ready to be played. After clicking the **Save** button, **Play** your Kidoju and your audio files.
