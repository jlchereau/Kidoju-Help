## Adding, removing, duplicating and sorting components {#adding-removing-duplicating-and-sorting-components}

To add a component to a page, expand the toolbox in the tools pane, click on the tool you want to use, then click on the stage in the middle pane to add the corresponding component:

When a component is selected (simply click on the component to select it), it is displayed with a bounding rectangle and four handles located in the corners of that rectangle:

*   The top left handle is the move handle;
*   The top-right handle is the rotate handle;
*   The bottom-right handle is the resize handle;
*   The bottom-left handle is the menu handle.

Click the menu handle to display commands to **Delete** and **Duplicate** the component.

After duplicating the image component, expand the **Page explorer** panel in the tools pane and drag its items to move them forward or backward (one on top of the other). Play with sorting and check which image displays on top of the other.

Note: when an image has been added to the stage after a label, it is displayed on top of that label. You need to change the order of components to display the label on top of the image.
