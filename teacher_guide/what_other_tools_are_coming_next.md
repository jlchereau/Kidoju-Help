## What other tools are coming next? {#what-other-tools-are-coming-next}

Although we do not commit to any deadline, we are working hard to expand this toolset with:

*   A vector drawing tool,
*   A code editor targeted at software programming quizzes,
*   Spreadsheets and tables,
*   Charts and plots,
*   Interactive maps,
*   A chemical formula editor;
*   A math geometry editor.
