## Styles {#styles}

In Kidoju, most components have one or more style properties.

The easy way to modify style properties is to use the formatting toolbar above the stage as in the example below.

The formatting toolbar only gives access to a limited set of style values. For fine-grained control over styles, expand the **Display attributes** collapsible panel and click the [â€¦] button of the **Style** property. Then add or modify any style values.

Note: styles conform to the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) specifications. More on CSS in the CSS styles chapter of the Advanced Guide.

When modifying styles, make sure they display well both with light and dark themes.
